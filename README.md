some descriptions:

- It may works like SpringBoard 7x10 items (add 2 pt between images) on iPhone with horizontal pagination.
- The top bar should contain two buttons: “+” and “Reload All”.
- On “+” button it should add a new image to the end of the list.
- “Reload All” function should remove all existing images and load 140 new. Images should be rounded with corner radius = 7.
- You can get new images by executing this request http://loremflickr.com/200/200/. Each request will response you with different image.
- Collection should scroll without any lags or freezes and be smooth. Also you need to appear activity indicator for cell if image not loaded yet.
